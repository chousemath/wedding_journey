# Introduction

* Love is a thing that's hard to define
    - it means a lot of different things in a lot of different situations
    - it can have conflicting meanings in some situations

# What love means to me

* Sue, as we've got to know each other, I've had the opportunity to reflect several times over on what love and the act of loving one another means to me in our union

* Here is what love and the act of loving one another means to me:
    - To love one another is to show each other the most vulnerable and imperfect parts of oneself (as an individual), and to feel that we've become stronger as a single unit afterwards.
    - Love is attempting to wake your partner up, find that she's still sleeping 5 minutes later, and repeating the previous steps another 10 times 
    - Love is entering every argument with the goal of understanding and self-betterment, learning as much about oneself as the person with whom you are having the argument
    - Love is about trust in another's abilities, but being ready to quietly swoop in at the other's side when needed

# What I believe the responsibilities of marriage entail

* The relationship of husband and wife, however, is more than simply being a team with a common goal.

# What I vow to do and why

* In progress...
