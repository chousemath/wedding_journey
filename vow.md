# Introduction

* Love is a thing that's hard to define
    - it means a lot of different things in a lot of different situations
    - it can have conflicting meanings in some situations

# What love means to me

* Sue, as we've got to know each other, I've had the opportunity to reflect several times over on what love and the act of loving one another means to me in our union

* Here is what love and the act of loving one another means to me:
    - To love one another is to show each other the most vulnerable and imperfect parts of oneself (as an individual), and to feel that we've become stronger as a single unit afterwards.
    - Love is attempting to wake your partner up, find that she's still sleeping 5 minutes later, and repeating the previous steps another 10 times 
    - Love is entering every argument with the goal of understanding and self-betterment, learning as much about oneself as the person with whom you are having the argument
    - Love is about trust in another's abilities, but being ready to quietly swoop in at the other's side when needed

# What I believe the responsibilities of marriage entail

* The relationship of husband and wife, however, is more than simply being a team with a common goal.

# What I vow to do and why

* I vow always to push you a little farther, because I know how much you want to see the world, and I will continue to work on that at your pace
* I vow to put us above all else, because if we can’t trust each other to do that, what is the point
* I vow to never give up on your dreams and work hard so that you don’t give up on them either, because life is hard enough already without a light at the end of the tunnel
* I vow to always try to surprise you in good ways, because we married each other as much for who we are as who we could become
* I vow to never shut you out when I go to dark places, because I know however much the darkness creeps in, you’ll be there to hold a candle to guide my way back
* I vow that in a zombie apocalypse I will either die protecting you, or keep you as my zombie wife as long as you are willing to keep me as your zombie husband, then we could have another, less complicated wedding ceremony

# Rough draft 2

* Su, as we've gotten to know each other, I've had the opportunity to reflect several times over on what love and the act of loving one another means to me. For me, love is showing each other our oddities and feeling our bond grow stronger as a result, like how you forget to bring your phone and your ID card, and my ability to make cheese disappear. Love is looking back thankfully at each disagreement as a moment of learning about each other, like when we clashed on what an actual date is. Love is trusting each other to do a good job, yet hovering by with a helping hand, like my hospital visits and your visa. Love is the knowledge that no matter how hard the day has been, the end of the day together will be exactly what's needed to recharge for the next, as all our strange conversations between midnight and 2am always are.
* I vow to work hard for us to see as much of the world as we can stand or until we can't stand, whichever comes first, because at the top of the Koko Crater Trail in Hawaii I saw in your eyes the endless desire for exploration that I’ve always had.
* I vow to never give up on your dreams and work hard so that you don’t give up on them either, because it took courage to quit a job you've worked in for 7 years and start again from scratch, and I admire that.
* I vow that in a zombie apocalypse I will either die protecting you, or keep you as my zombie wife as long as you are willing to keep me as your zombie husband, then we could have another, less complicated wedding ceremony
* Above all else, I vow never to create showers of tears [insert friend's poem snippet here]. Love you forever SuSu.

For me, love is showing each other our imperfections and feeling our bond grow stronger as a result. Love is looking back thankfully at each argument and disagreement as a moment of learning about each other. Love is trusting each other to do a good job, yet hovering by with a helping hand.

* Maybe have a short memory snippet for each "what love means to me" point

* Love used to be infinitely vast, but now it's a little more concrete

* Maybe prepare some real life examples for each vow and decide then whether to include or not

* Value authenticity, shouldn't be over-grandiose, should be grounded

* I vow to work hard for us to see as much of the world as we can stand or until we can't stand, whichever comes first.

* I vow to never give up on your dreams and work hard so that you don’t give up on them either.

* I vow to always try to surprise you in good ways.

* I vow that in a zombie apocalypse I will either die protecting you, or keep you as my zombie wife as long as you are willing to keep me as your zombie husband, then we could have another, less complicated wedding ceremony

* Above all else, I vow to put us above all else, because I trust that you will do the same. Love you forever SuSu.
