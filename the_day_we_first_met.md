# The day we first met

The day we first met was a day of laughter and pleasant misunderstandings. My Korean was on par with your English, resulting at times in lulls in conversation, and chuckles at our own lingual deficiencies. It was clear from the outset that spoken language would be an inadequate tool for us to get know each other better, and more importantly, that you were a person with whom I felt at ease enough to want to get to know better. We dug enthusiastically for our common interests much like puppies dig for bones at the seashore, hoping for the glimpse of ivory needed to justify our efforts to keep the night from collapsing in a deluge of sand and saltwater.
